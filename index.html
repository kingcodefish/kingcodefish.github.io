    <h1>Linear Regression</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <p class="fs-5 col-md-8">A powerful tool for finding the implications of a data set. More formally, "a linear approach for modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables" (Wikipedia). For our example, we will be developing linear regressions to analyze plant height data with various explanatory variables to determine which has the most explaining power for the data.</p>

        <h2>Scatter Plots</h2>
        <p>In the plant height assignment, scatter plots were used to make the data point correlation to the regression line clear. Having a scatter plot shows how the data interacts with the line of best fit once drawn since it expresses the non-linearity of the data and in what ways the line characterizes it and/or makes some unfair assumptions about the data. Clarity aside, plotting the diagram for a scatter plot is simple and makes makes debugging simple.</p>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Line of Best Fit</h2>
        <p>The line of best fit of the scatter plot is simply the line that minimizes the variance off the line. There are several misconceptions regarding the line of best fit. It does not always go through the first and last points on a scatter plot, those points can be outliers too! Likewise, steeper trend lines do not indicate stronger correlations necessarily. To calculate it, the least square method is used. The slope is calculated where the sum of the product of errors of the x-mean and y-mean is then divided by the sum of the errors of the x-mean squared. The y-intercept is then just the y-mean minus the slope times the x-mean.</p>

        <h2>Standard Error</h2>
        <p>The standard error of a sample mean is the standard deviation of the mean for the dataset. In the plant heights dataset, we measure the standard error of the line mean and the y mean for calculating the r squared term.</p>
